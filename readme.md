This is a small project to test the setup of using JavaFX with Kotlin. It shows how to create the application and how to run tests on it. The requirement is to make use of FXML, CSS and a Controller.

It's also showing how to run JavaFX tests on travis -> use service xvfb and execute command 'export DISPLAY=:99.0' before the install.

Currently, the project uses JDK 11 and the corresponding JavaFX version.
