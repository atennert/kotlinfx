# kotlinfx

This is a small project to test the setup of using JavaFX with Kotlin. It shows how to create the application and how to run tests on it. The requirement is to make use of FXML, CSS and a Controller.

Currently, the project uses JDK 12 and the corresponding JavaFX version. It doesn't use modules because quite frankly, I didn't get it running with modules :-(.
